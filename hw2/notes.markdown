## 14 OP Inheritance2

### Instances 

1. A pointer to the base address of an instance of the subclass can also be treated as if it were a superclass object and it just works since the objects look the same from the bottom up.

2. abstract: has a prototype but no code.

3. instanceof with a *null* pointer always returns false.
  1. Using instanceof is regarded as a possible sign of poor design. Ideally, the right piece of code should be selected by the method depending on the class of receiver. Sometimes instanceof is required.
  2. We should avoid doing manual if/switch logic with class objects.

### Java Interface

1. defines a set of method prototypes, no code.
2. can also define final constants.
3. A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods in the interface.
4. A java class can only have one super class, but it may implement any number of interfaces.
5. If an object implements the Foo interface, a pointer to the object may be stored in a Foo variable. (Similar to superclass in this sense.)
6. C++ multiple inheritance is more capable, but it introduces a lot of compiler and language complexity. Interfacs provide 80% of the benifit for 10% of the complexity.
7. Example:
  1. The Comparable interface
  2. Objects that work with Java's build-in sorting machinery implement the Comparable interface, which defines the one method compareTo()
  
```java
public interface Comparable {
  public int compareTo(Object other);
}
```
  
  3. compareTo() returns negative if receiver is less, 0 if same, positive if more.
  4. in newer versions of Java, comparable has been made generic.

### Object Class
1. The Object class is the Universal superclass in Java -- every object is, at some distance, a subclass of Object.
2. Object methodsï¼š
  - boolean equals(Object other); //deep comparason.
    * default definition: print object's class and address.
    * println() and String "+" know to call toString() automatically
    * can be handy for debugging
  - int hashCode(); //int hash summary of object 
  - String toString(); //String form of object
  - Class getClass(); //Ask an object what its class is
