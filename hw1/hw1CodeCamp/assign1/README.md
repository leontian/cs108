In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.

**HashSet** class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. This class permits the null element.


### When to use *this* keyword?

It's not necessary to use *this* unless there would be ambiguities without it, i.e. when there are parameters with the same names as fields.

### Two ways of using Array.asList()

```
1. List<String> foo = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(foo2))
2. List<String> foo = Arrays.asList(foo2)
```

Second is better performance-wise BUT: it returns a List with an immutable size. Meaning you cannot add/remove elements to/from it:

Returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. (Changes to the returned list "write through" to the array.)

### Remove while iterating

To safely remove from a collection while iterating over it you should use an Iterator.

For example:

```
List<String> names = ....
Iterator<String> i = names.iterator();
while (i.hasNext()) {
   String s = i.next(); // must be called before you can call i.remove()
   // Do something
   i.remove();
}
```
From the Java Documentation :

The iterators returned by this class's iterator and listIterator methods are fail-fast: if the list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
Perhaps what is unclear to many novices is the fact that iterating over a list using the for/foreach constructs implicitly creates an iterator which is necessarily inaccessible. This info can be found here http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html
